# Exploratory Data Analysis of My Movie Ratings
Personal Project
## Overview
With the goal of better understanding my movie preferences, I conducted exploratory data analysis using data from 499 movies I've rated on IMDb. After exploring and cleaning the data, I applied machine learning classification algorithms to predict my movie ratings.
## Summary
* Used correlation plot to detect multicollinearity
* Normalized skewed data
* Generated dummy variables for categorical predictors
* Standardized all numeric variables
* Built naive bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, support vector classifier, xgboost, and voting classifier models to predict movie rating with best test accuracy of 69.3%
